# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-Using-SQL
Project using SQLite

The CIA factbook contains the following information about all of the countries in the world:

Population
Area
Area of water
Area of land
Population growth
Birth rate
Death rate
Migration rate
The questions that I will answer are:

What are the highest and lowest populations and also what are the highest and lowest population growths?
What is the average population and area of each country?
Which countries have above average population but lower than average area size?
Which country has the most people? Which country has the highest growth rate?
Which countries have the highest ratios of water to land? Which countries have more water than land?
Which countries will add the most people to their populations next year?
Which countries have a higher death rate than birth rate?
Which countries have the highest population/area ratio, and how does it compare to list we found in the previous screen?
